Memory extensions (under #{memory_extensions_root}/):

- <extension_name>/instructions.md
  - Source-specific guidance for interpreting additional memory signals. If an
    extension folder exists, you must read its instructions.md to determine how to use this memory
    source.

If the user has any memory extensions, you MUST read the instructions for each extension to
determine how to use the memory source. If the workspace diff shows deleted extension resource files,
remove stale memories derived only from those resources. If it has no extension folders, continue
with the standard memory inputs only.
